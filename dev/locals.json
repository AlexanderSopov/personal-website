Most of their employees are PhD's or industry veterans and so require a high precision on their orders and demand quality in the work that I do for them. As such, I apreciate our collaboration since it pushes me to my limits every time, which is where I love to live."

							"Most blogs (and other websites, too) are using a CMS like Wordpress. These tools are great if you're a news outlet or online media company that generates content every day. If that's not the case, then you're really slowing down your users experience and burdering your finances with the hosting... But it's so simple to use, right? Well, what if there was a CMS for the middle guy? A CMS that pre-compiles websites into static ones that gets served to the user in an instant? Well, we all know that googles SEO-algorithms would love that, and so too would the customers. This is what Teddybear Studios, a Gothenburg based startup is working on."
